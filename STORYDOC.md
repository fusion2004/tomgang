## Basic Plot / Stream of Consciousness

Universe fucking breaks, man.

Guy named 'Tom', does it somehow. Regular guy, scientist? Makes a time travel machine, instead of working it breaks down the laws of physics. Time begins to compress and collapse, space-time breaks into localized chunks.

With special equipment, you can navigate the mess that all of existence has become; capability to essentially travel to any 'time' or 'place' without conventional time and spacial travel. (i.e. time travel is now irrelevant because time is no longer linear or universal).

Each player is someone who gains technology for both navigation and also localizing a space-time field to just themselves that over relative time allows them to become singularly more powerful.

'Haven' is a single space-time that is kept stabilized so travelers like the players have a place they can meet and keep their own timelines stable and linear. 'Haven' is also the name of the technology, because it keeps players timelines' linear with each other, regardless of other travel.
